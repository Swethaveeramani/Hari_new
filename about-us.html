                <h5>The founder Mr. Hari (a) Aravindan's love for cooking, cultivated at his father's hotel in Cudaloore
                    while playing around the hotel's kitchen.</h5>
                <h5>The Hotel was very successful in Cudaloore in the streets of Mela Masi Veedi. However, the ultimately
                    death of his father brought the hotel's chapter to a close, plunging the family into financial
                    hardship.</h5>
                <h5>At the age of 14, Mr. Hari decide to earn for his family and journeyed to Erode to seek employment.
                    With his love for food and cooking in his blood, he joined Mr. Gopal Iyer and learned proper
                    culinary art, where his desire for cooking truly bloomed day by day.</h5>
                <h5>His passion for excellent cuisine drove every step of his career, so he knew that in order to prepare
                    the food he wanted and work for a business he was proud of, he would need to create his own catering
                    company.</h5>
                <h5>In the Year 1979, with all the blessings of Mr. Gopal Iyer and with the help of friends and
                    well-wishers Hari Catering Service was born.</h5>

                    management expertise;these experiences ultimately inspired his decision to pursue a degree in
                    Catering Management at SRM University, Chennai.</h5>
                <h5>Upon graduating from college, he was able to recognize his capabilities and subsequently assumed the
                    leadership of the front end of the business, providing support and guidance to his father across all
